## About the Project

The **To-Do List Management System** is a simple and efficient C++ console application designed to manage daily tasks using a linked list data structure.

Traditional to-do systems rely on paper or mobile apps, but this mini-project demonstrates how task management can be implemented using core programming concepts like pointers, structs, and sorting logic.

With this software:
- Add tasks with description and deadline
- Delete tasks by ID
- Display all tasks sorted by deadline
- Store tasks efficiently in a linked list

---

## Key Features
- Add tasks with an auto-generated ID
- Store tasks in a sorted linked list (ascending by deadline)
- Delete any task by entering its ID
- Display all tasks with details
- Simple and clean terminal UI
- Demonstrates pointer handling and memory management
